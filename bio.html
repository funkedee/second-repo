    <p>I grew up in a small town in Wisconsin about 25 miles southwest of Madison. After graduating High School I moved to Madison to go to Engineering school at University of Wisconsin.  I left after one year to move to Longmont, Colorado in 2013 and got a job as a line cook. In 2014, I left my line cook job and started a Property Maintanence/ landscaping position and moved to Boulder . After living in Boulder for a 4 years took a 6 month leave to live in a van and travel the West coast.  When I came back to Boulder, I decided I was ready for a change and wanted to start a new career as a Web Developer. And so I enrolled in this class. </p>
